**Abstract**

*Objective*: Examine the longitudinal associations between social support and verbal memory
among community-dwelling adults.

*Participants*: In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 10,837 participants aged 50-89
years were assessed at wave 1 (baseline: 2002-03) and followed-up over 14-years to wave 8
(2016-17).

*Methods*: Verbal memory was assessed at each wave by tests of immediate and delayed
word-recall. Positive and negative social support were measured across four types of
relationship (spouse/partner, children, friends, extended family). Linear mixed effects
modelling examined the between-person (PM) and within-person (PM) associations between
social support and verbal memory. Interaction terms were fitted to estimate differences in the
rate of change in verbal memory by social support.

*Results*: When we summed scores across all relationships (global social support), higher-than-
average (PM) positive social support was associated with higher baseline verbal
memory (β<sup>PM</sup> = 0.015; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.008, 0.025; p < 0.001) and with
slower decline (β<sup>PM-by-time</sup> = 0.003; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.005; p = 0.003). Longitudinal
associations were gender- and source-specific. Among men, slower decline in verbal memory
was associated with higher positive social support from children (β<sup>PM-by-time</sup> = 0.009; 95% CI:
0.002, 0.016; p = 0.011) and with lower negative social support from spouse/partner (β<sup>PM-by-time</sup>
= -0.016; 95% CI: -0.031, 0.000; p = 0.045) and from friends (β<sup>PM-by-time</sup> = -0.021; 95%
CI: -0.039, -0.004; p = 0.018). Among women, higher positive social support from extended
family was associated with slower decline in verbal memory (β<sup>PM-by-time</sup> = 0.008; 95% CI:
0.000, 0.015; p = 0.049).

*Conclusions*: Between-person differences in social support were modestly associated with
differential decline in verbal memory. Our findings can inform future research studies and
intervention strategies designed to maximise the potential role of supportive relationships in
promoting healthy cognitive ageing.
